# Bitcrush

## Alright, let's do this one last time.

Developers: Olivia Forman & Rui Zhao and also nathan and jordan help thanks guys

Bitcrush is a unique take on the rhythm game genre that mixes a traditional DDR-style format with RPG-esque turn-based combat elements. Attack on your turns, defend on your opponents, and choose strategic moves on each! For example, if you're racking up a good combo as your turn rolls around, you can choose a move that capitalizes on that to deal extra damage, while taking the risk of heavily weakening your attacks if you break it. Explore an urban fantasy world where music is magic as Ria Gallagher, a college dropout secretly hyper-talented wannabe musician, as she tries to get back her guitar from a mysterious thief.
