CUTSCENE #1
 Ria comes onto the scene by hopping off of what appears to be an 8th Note themed delivery bike. It’s around dusk by now, and Ria’s clearly tired.

 She thinks to herself in her head:

RIA:
Geez, I can’t wait to just unwind, forget about today and get a little music-action goin’ on!

The screen fades to black.
She enters the apartment, and then heads into her room…
And finds, a rather stressful change.

RIA:
I- wait- What? You’ve gotta be joking...Wait…W-where is it?!? Hey! Maddie!!

MADELINE:
Yo.

The screen fades back into Ria’s Messy Room. Seems like it’s been broken into. Womp Womp.
Ria’s character portrait slides in from the left, and Madeline’s from the right.

RIA:
First off, what happened to my room, and second off-

WHERE’S MY GUITAR?!?

MADELINE:


Hmm, beats me- Althoouuuuuugh! There was someone who broke in here all shadowy, broke in through the window, made a mess everywhere, and then smoke bombed outta here with your guitar.

I tried to stop’em, but they were gone before I could do anything.

Insert a flashback of Madeline eating a bag of chips, entering Ria’s room hearing all the ruckus, only for her and the shadowy figure to make eye-contact, before the shadow smoke bombs out, and Madeline drops her bag of chips on the floor out of shock. 

Just before the flashback ends, Madeline can be seen cartoonishly anguished by dropping her chips, and not the absolute wreck Ria’s room is in.

RIA:
Well, that’s just great. Did you at least see anything that stood out about the guy?

Glasses suddenly materialize onto Madeine’s face, alongside a whiteboard being propped up in the background.

MADELINE:
Well, I think he had blue eyes, if that helps. Kinda sparkly too.

RIA:
Sparkling blue eyes...which jerk do I know that has those?

Ria and Madeline’s sprites both turn into thinking sprites, before they both come to the same answer.



RIA & MADELINE:
. . .

RIA & MADELINE:
Adin!

MADELINE:
Girl, we’re like, so in sync!

RIA:
I know right? But okay, back on track.

RIA:
It HAS to be him.

MADELINE:
Didn’t he like, try to confess to you and you rejected him and stuff?

RIA:
Well, yeah! He’s a frat boy, ‘asked me “Did it hurt when you fell from heaven?”, and I said: “No, I clipped my wings to get away from guys like you.”

MADELINE:
Well, seems like he didn’t get the hint if he’s doing stuff like this. He probably took your guitar to be petty.

RIA:
Yeah, he would, but where would he be now?

MADELINE:
Well, actually- Iiii might be able to help with that.

*Madeline hands Ria a poster.*
*An image of a poster pops up inbetween Ria and Madeline.

RIA:
“ADIN AND THE BOYS, PERFORMING LIVE! TODAY! (Yes, Today) AT 7:00 PM!”
Where…where’d you find this?
MADELINE:
Backyard.

RIA:
We…don’t have a backyard.

MADELINE:
I’m aware.

RIA:
Anyway, ‘guess we’ll have to confront him right then and there! I’m not letting that punk run away and use my guitar for his dumb concert!

MADELINE:
Woo! Let’s go cause problems on PURPOSE..! Although, there is- One teeny tiny little problem.

RIA:
What’s up?

MADELINE:
It’s 6:50.

RIA:
6:50?!? Shoot, we gotta get going!

Ria thinks to herself: Adin’s frat or whatever should be across campus to the right.

Insert a fade to black transition, or allow the player to traverse the overworld and talk to a couple of people while on their way to the big frat house with the large LED: “ADIN AND THE BOYS”.

CUTSCENE #2

Ria and Madeline barge into the Frat House just before “ADIN AND THE BOYS” are about to start performing.

RIA:
ADIN!!!! WHERE’S MY GUITAR?!?

A stage-light casts light in an otherwise completely empty stage, to which Adin quickly runs into, and bows, extending his hand from the stage and over to Ria.

ADIN:
My my, Ria! Couldn’t resist the Adinator, could you?

RIA:
Can-it, jerkwad. Me and Maddie know you took my guitar! So cut to the chase and hand it over!
Madeline is right beside Ria, looking akin to a marketable plushie.

ADIN:
Mmmmmmhmhmhm, what if I don’t want to?
He says, winking with the SMUGGEST of smirks on his face.

Ria starts to run down the aisle, before hopping on the stage and getting a spotlight pointed on herself.

RIA:
Then I’l just have to beat it out of you! Don’t think I won’t!

ADIN:
Still winking, Adin laughs.
Please, Ria, and with what instrument?

The lights turn on, revealing the stage properly and how the entire venue has been decorated to resemble an orchestra.

Likewise, Adin’s “band members” are all other parts of thar orchestra, with Adin being the lead piano in charge. Ria’s character sprite turns to one of doubt, somewhat unsure of what to do now.

MADELINE:
WITH THIS ONE! GO GET’EM GIRL!

Madeline yoinks a violin from one of the people in the audience, and yeets it over to Ria, the violin appropriately and comedically decking her best friend in the face, but Ria doesn’t falter by any means, instead, standing proud and picking up the violin, challenging Adin to a music battle.

RIA:
If I win, YOU tell me what happened to my guitar? Got that?

ADIN:
And if I win, then you, Ria Gallegher, have to date me…Deal?

RIA:
Deal.

LET THE BATTLE COMMENCE!
